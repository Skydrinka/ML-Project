# ML-Project
Project to showcase my machine learning and data analytics skills

# Project Scoping
Properly scoping your project will greatly benefit you; scoping creates structure while requiring you to think through your entire project before you begin. You should start with stating the goals for your project, then gathering the data, and then considering the analytical steps required. A proper project scope can be a great road map for your project, but keep in mind that some down-stream tasks may become dead ends which will require adjustment to the scope.

# Select ML-Solvable Problem
First, choose a topic of interest; then, within your topic, select a problem that you’d like to solve by building a machine learning pipeline

Make sure that this problem can be solved in a reasonable amount of time and with available data. If the problem is too complex, it might be worth breaking it down into smaller units.

# Select a dataset
If you didn’t already have a dataset in mind, search the internet and see if it’s freely available. If data is not available, go back to the previous step and find a new problem that will have data readily available.

# Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)
You likely have multiple datasets that you would like to integrate in some form. Extract data from these multiple sources, transform them using pandas and load the transformed dataset onto where you would like to store it!

# Feature Engineering
Perform feature engineering on the dataset. A crucial step to take before implementing any data transformations is to carry out a train-test-validation split.

# Implement Machine Learning Workflow
This is likely the most time consuming part of this project! You will iterate over multiple ML models and evaluate them to choose the one that suits the problem the best. Implement the different steps in a workflow including and not limited to: feature engineering, model building and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning and model validation.

# Build ML Pipeline
Once you have a fully functional and performant workflow, you’re ready to modularize your code and turn it into a pipeline! Use scikit-learn‘s Pipeline module to implement this step.

# Communicate your Findings
Make your visualizations and documented findings easy to decipher for potential stakeholders and/or the general public. You can also write a conclusion about your process and findings.

# Conclusion and Next Steps
Being a machine learning engineer is about making continual progress. What are future-looking takeaways and limitations? If you were to do this project again, how can you extend this analysis?
